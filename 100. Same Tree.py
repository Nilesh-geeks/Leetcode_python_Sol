Question :: 100. Same Tree

Given the roots of two binary trees p and q, write a function to check if they are the same or not.

Two binary trees are considered the same if they are structurally identical, and the nodes have the same value.

Code::
class Solution:
    def isSameTree(self, p: Optional[TreeNode], q: Optional[TreeNode]) -> bool:
        if not p and not q:
            return True
        if not p or not q:
            return False
        return p.val == q.val and self.isSameTree(p.left , q.left) and self.isSameTree(p.right , q.right)
